Historically, the fundamental role of pharmacists as a healthcare practitioner was
to check and distribute drugs to doctors for medication that had been prescribed to
patients. In more modern times, pharmacists advise patients and health care providers
on the selection, dosages, interactions, and side effects of medications, and act as a
learned intermediary between a prescriber and a patient. Pharmacists monitor the health
and progress of patients to ensure the safe and effective use of medication. Pharmacists
may practice compounding; however, many medicines are now produced by pharmaceutical companies
in a standard dosage and drug delivery form. In some jurisdictions, pharmacists have prescriptive
authority to either independently prescribe under their own authority or in collaboration with a primary
care physician through an agreed upon protocol.
